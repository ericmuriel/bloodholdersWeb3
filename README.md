This repository was a project based on web3 cryptogame. The services and all based on azure deploy is broken because this project was ended. The button of Gift is broken too, but you can see all the code of web3, Tailwind styles, next.js routes and Typescript code. This was one of my biggest projects that I worked for more than 3 months.

I was working with 3 more developers and it was so grateful for me beacuse I learned a lot and I felt so loved with web3 technology and this news techs like next.js,typescript and tailwind.

Any question im opened to answer :). ericmuriel@hotmail.com
